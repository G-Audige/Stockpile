# **Stockpile**
---

## **Description**
Stockpile is a game where two players in turns each control on a grid one square that represents a minikin. The goal of the game is to gather food pips that occasionally appear on the board and have more at the last round than the opponent.

## **Functionality**
Stockpile is played on a 23x17 grid and games are divided into 5 rounds which are themselves divided into two turns. When the square being controled by a player takes over the spot of a square representing a food pip, that player's food pip count goes up. The players's turn ends when they return to their nest to deposit all of their held food pips or run out of the alloted steps for the turn, in which case they will deposit half of their held food pips. Every 10 steps, new food pips may appear on the board if there are three or less food pips present.

## **How to Play**
-Players control the minikin square with directional or WASD keystrokes <br>
-Players gain food pips by moving their minikin square over food pip squares <br>
-Players end their turn by returning to the nest square that they initially spawn in front of <br>
-Players have only a limited amount of movement allowed for each turn and their turn will end automatically with half of their held food pips lost of they run out of steps <br>
-The winning player is determined by which one has the most food pips at the end of 5 rounds. <br>
